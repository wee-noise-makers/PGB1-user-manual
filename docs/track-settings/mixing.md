# Mixing

The PGB-1 provides essential mixing controls for each track, allowing you to balance your sounds and add effects.

## Volume

### Track Volume

Located on page 4 of track settings.

- Controls the overall level of the track
- Use ++up++ / ++down++ or the touch strip to adjust

### Master Volume

Hold ++play++ and press ++up++ / ++down++ to adjust the master output volume.

!!! warning "Hearing Safety"
    Maximum volume can be very loud, especially with headphones. Prolonged exposure to high volume may damage your hearing.

## Pan (Stereo Position)

Located on page 5 of track settings.

| Value | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Left | Sound in left channel |
| Center | Sound in both channels equally |
| Right | Sound in right channel |

Use panning to create width and separation in your mix.

## Track Effects

Located on page 6 of track settings.

Each track can have one insert effect applied:

### None (Bypass)

No effect applied. Use when you want the dry sound.

### Drive

Adds harmonic distortion and warmth.

- Low settings add subtle saturation
- High settings create aggressive distortion
- Great for kicks, bass, and adding presence

!!! tip "Drive Level"
    If drive sounds too quiet, increase the drive amount - it may be set too low to be audible.

### Reverb

Adds space and ambience.

- Creates a sense of room or hall
- Useful for pads, leads, and snares
- Be careful not to muddy your mix with too much reverb

### Filter

Applies a resonant filter to the track.

- Shapes the frequency content
- Can add character and movement
- Useful for taming harsh frequencies

### Beat Crusher

Reduces bit depth and sample rate for lo-fi effects.

- Creates digital distortion
- Adds grit and texture
- Great for drums and percussion

## Mixing Tips

### Creating Space

1. Keep kick and bass centered
2. Pan hi-hats slightly off-center
3. Spread melodic elements across the stereo field
4. Use reverb sparingly on low frequencies

### Balance

1. Start with all tracks at similar volumes
2. Adjust kick and snare as your foundation
3. Bring in bass to complement the kick
4. Add melodic elements at appropriate levels

### Using Effects

- Drive works well on kicks and bass for punch
- Reverb on snares adds depth
- Beat Crusher can make drums sound vintage
- Not every track needs an effect - sometimes dry is best

## Quick Adjustments

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Master Volume Up | Hold ++play++ + ++up++ |

| Solo Track | Hold ++play++ + ++track++ then ++1++-++16++ |
