# Arpeggiator

The arpeggiator automatically plays notes from the current chord in a pattern, adding melodic movement to your tracks.

## How It Works

When a step is set to use the arpeggiator (in Step Mode), instead of playing a fixed note, it plays notes from the current chord according to the arpeggiator settings.

## Arpeggiator Settings

Located on pages 9 and 10 of track settings.

### Mode (Page 9)

Determines the pattern of notes played:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Up | Plays notes from lowest to highest |
| Down | Plays notes from highest to lowest |
| Up/Down | Alternates between up and down |
| Random | Plays notes in random order |
| Order | Plays notes in chord order (1, 2, 3, 4) |

### Notes (Page 10)

Select which notes the arpeggiator uses. Currently, chord notes are the primary option.

## Using the Arpeggiator

### In Step Settings

Each step can be set to use different note modes:

1. Enter Step Mode
2. Select a step
3. Navigate to the Note setting
4. Press ++a++ to cycle through modes:
    - Chord (plays full chord)
    - Note 1, 2, 3, 4 (specific chord note)
    - Arpeggiator (uses track arp settings)
    - Fixed (specific MIDI note)

### Default Track Behavior

- **Bass Track**: Steps play the chord root note by default
- **Lead Track**: Steps use the arpeggiator by default
- **Chords Track**: Steps play the full chord

## Creative Uses

### Melodic Leads

1. Select Lead track
2. Set Arpeggiator Mode to Random
3. Create a pattern with multiple steps
4. The melody will vary with each chord change

### Controlled Melodies

Mix arpeggiator steps with fixed note steps:

1. Set important melody notes (step 1, 5, etc.) to specific chord notes
2. Set fill notes to Arpeggiator
3. This creates melodies that always land on key notes

### Bass Lines

1. Select Bass track
2. Use Arpeggiator mode for variation
3. First beat plays root, others arpeggiate

## Arpeggiator and Chord Progressions

The arpeggiator automatically follows chord progressions:

1. Set up a chord progression in Song Mode
2. Steps set to Arpeggiator will play notes from whatever chord is currently active
3. Your melody automatically harmonizes with the chords

## Mixing Note Types

Within a single pattern, you can mix:

| Note Type | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| Chord Note 1 (Root) | Landing points, bass notes |
| Chord Note 3 | Melodic emphasis |
| Arpeggiator | Fills, runs, variation |
| Fixed Note | Notes outside the chord |

## Tips

- Use Random arpeggiator mode for generative melodies
- Set key melody notes to specific chord notes for control
- The arpeggiator respects the track's octave setting
- Combine with step conditions for even more variation
