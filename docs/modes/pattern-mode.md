# Pattern Mode

Pattern Mode allows you to configure the length of patterns and link multiple patterns together for longer sequences.

## Entering Pattern Mode

Press ++pattern++ to enter Pattern Mode. The Pattern LED will light up.

## Understanding Patterns

- Each track has **16 patterns**
- Each pattern has up to **16 steps** by default
- Patterns can be linked together to create sequences up to **256 steps** (16 patterns x 16 steps)

## Selecting Patterns

In Pattern Mode:

- Press ++1++ to ++16++ to select a pattern
- The selected pattern number appears at the top right of the screen

To select a pattern without changing mode:

- Hold ++pattern++ and press ++1++ to ++16++

!!! warning "Important"
    Selecting a pattern does not play it. Which pattern plays for each track is determined in Song Mode.

## Pattern Settings

### Length

Set how many steps the pattern contains (1-16 steps).

Navigate to the length setting and use ++up++ / ++down++ to adjust.

### Link

Link this pattern to the next pattern. When enabled, the next pattern will automatically play after this one completes.

Use ++a++ to enable linking, ++b++ to disable.

## Pattern Linking Visualization

### On Screen

A visual representation shows which patterns are linked together.

### LED Indicators

- **Blue LED**: Currently selected pattern
- **Cyan LEDs**: Patterns linked to the selected pattern

## Creating Long Patterns

To create patterns longer than 16 steps:

1. Enter Pattern Mode
2. Select the first pattern (e.g., Pattern 1)
3. Set length to 16 (or desired length)
4. Enable Link to connect to Pattern 2
5. Select Pattern 2
6. Set its length
7. Continue linking patterns as needed

### Example: 32-Step Pattern

1. Pattern 1: Length 16, Link enabled
2. Pattern 2: Length 16, Link disabled

This creates a 32-step sequence that plays Pattern 1 followed by Pattern 2.

### Maximum Length

Link all 16 patterns together for a maximum of 256 steps (16 x 16).

## Tips

- Use shorter patterns for drums and longer patterns for melodies
- Link patterns to create song sections (verse, chorus, etc.)
- Remember that pattern length affects when Song Parts change
