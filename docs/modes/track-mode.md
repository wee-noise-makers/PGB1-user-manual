# Track Mode

Track mode allows you to configure the 16 tracks of the PGB-1. By default,
tracks 1 to 6 are synths tracks (Kick, Snare, Hihat, Bass, Lead, Chords),
tracks 7 and 8 are sample tracks, tracks 9 to 11 are audio FX tracks, and
tracks 12 to 16 are MIDI tracks. Note that all tracks can be configured to MIDI
mode and control external devices ([more details here](../audio-midi/midi.md)).
In Track mode, pressing one of the ++1++ to ++16++ buttons will select the
corresponding track and trigger a "preview" note for this track. The name of
the selected track is shown at the top left of the screen.

## Selecting Tracks

In Track Mode:

- Press ++1++ to ++16++ to select a track and trigger a preview note
- The selected track name appears at the top left of the screen

To select a track **without** playing a preview:

- Hold ++track++ and press ++1++ to ++16++

## Track Settings Pages

Navigate between pages using ++left++ and ++right++. Each track has multiple
settings pages, and different pages depending on the track type (synth, FX,
MIDI).

Here is the list of pages for synth tracks:

### Page 1: Synth Engine

Select the sound engine for the track. Use ++up++ and ++down++ to scroll
through available engines. See [Synth
Engines](../track-settings/synth-engines.md) for a complete list.

### Page 2: Engine Parameters

Four parameters specific to the selected synth engine. Parameters vary by engine (e.g., Shape, Decay, Cutoff, Resonance).

### Page 3: LFO

Configure the [Low Frequency Oscillator](../track-settings/lfo.md):

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Rate | Speed of the LFO |
| Amplitude | Intensity of modulation |
| Shape | Waveform shape + Sync (S) and Loop (L) options |
| Target | Which parameter the LFO modulates |

### Page 4: Volume

Set the track volume level.

### Page 5: Pan

Set the stereo position of the track.

### Page 6: Effect

- Up
- Down
- Up/Down
- Random
- Order

### Page 10: Arpeggiator Notes

Configure which notes the [arpeggiator](../track-settings/arpeggiator.md) uses.

### Page 11: Track Mode
