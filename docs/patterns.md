# Pattern Settings

Patterns are the building blocks of your music on the PGB-1. Each track has 16 patterns, and each pattern contains up to 16 steps.

## Accessing Pattern Settings

1. Press ++pattern++ to enter Pattern Mode
2. Press ++1++ to ++16++ to select a pattern
3. Use ++left++ / ++right++ to navigate settings

## Pattern Structure

- Each track has **16 patterns** (numbered 1-16)
- Each pattern has up to **16 steps**
- Patterns can be linked together for longer sequences

## Pattern Settings

### Length

Sets how many steps the pattern contains (1-16).

Use ++up++ / ++down++ to adjust the length.

| Length | Steps |
|--------|-------|
| 1 | Very short, useful for single hits |
| 4 | Quarter pattern |
| 8 | Half pattern |
| 16 | Full pattern (default) |

### Link

Connects this pattern to the next one. When linked:

- The next pattern plays automatically after this one
- Creates sequences longer than 16 steps
- Useful for complex arrangements

Press ++a++ to enable linking, ++b++ to disable.

## Pattern Linking

### How It Works

When Pattern 1 is linked to Pattern 2:

1. Sequencer plays all steps of Pattern 1
2. Automatically continues to Pattern 2
3. After Pattern 2 completes, returns to Pattern 1 (if not linked further)

### Visual Feedback

**On Screen:**
A diagram shows which patterns are linked together.

**LED Indicators:**

- **Blue**: Currently selected pattern
- **Cyan**: Patterns linked to the selected pattern

### Creating Extended Patterns

#### 32-Step Pattern

1. Select Pattern 1
2. Set Length to 16
3. Enable Link
4. Select Pattern 2
5. Set Length to 16
6. Leave Link disabled

#### 64-Step Pattern

1. Link Pattern 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
2. Set each to 16 steps
3. Total: 64 steps

#### Maximum Length (256 Steps)

Link all 16 patterns together, each with 16 steps.

### Variable Length Patterns

Mix different lengths for complex rhythms:

| Pattern | Length | Link |
|---------|--------|------|
| 1 | 12 | Yes |
| 2 | 16 | Yes |
| 3 | 8 | No |

Total: 36 steps with varying section lengths.

## Pattern Tips

### Per-Track Patterns

Each track has its own independent patterns. You can have:

- Kick: 16-step pattern
- Hi-hat: 32-step pattern (2 linked)
- Lead: 64-step pattern (4 linked)

### Song Parts and Patterns

In Song Mode, you select which pattern plays for each track. Different song parts can use:

- The same pattern with different tracks muted
- Different patterns for different sections
- Linked patterns for longer variations

### Polyrhythms

Create interesting rhythms by using different pattern lengths:

- Track 1: 16 steps
- Track 2: 12 steps
- Track 3: 7 steps

The patterns cycle at different rates, creating evolving grooves.

### Quick Pattern Selection

From any mode, hold ++pattern++ and press ++1++-++16++ to select a pattern without changing modes.

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Begin with 16-step patterns before linking
2. **Plan ahead**: Think about your song structure before linking patterns
3. **Use lengths creatively**: Odd lengths (5, 7, 12) create interesting rhythms
4. **Keep variations**: Create similar patterns with small changes for song sections
