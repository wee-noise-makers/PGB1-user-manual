# Live FX

The PGB-1 features 16 live effects that can be activated during playback for dynamic performances.

## Accessing Live FX

Hold **Cpy/FX** and press ++1++ to ++16++ to toggle effects.

## Effect Categories

Effects are split into two categories:

- **Sequencing Effects** (left side: 1-4, 9-12) - Affect pattern playback
- **Mixing Effects** (right side: 5-8, 13-16) - Affect audio output

## Sequencing Effects

### Roll Effects

Create note repeats at different speeds:

| Button | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| ++1++ | Roll 16th | Fast rolls (16th notes) |
| ++2++ | Roll 8th | Medium rolls (8th notes) |
| ++3++ | Roll Quarter | Slow rolls (quarter notes) |
| ++4++ | Roll Beat | Slowest rolls (whole beat) |

Hold the button to sustain the roll effect.

### Fill Effects

Add or modify steps automatically:

| Button | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| ++9++ | Fill Steps | Triggers steps with "Fill" condition |
| ++10++ | Auto-fill Low | Random fills, lower probability |
| ++11++ | Auto-fill High | Random fills, higher probability |
| ++12++ | Auto-fill Build-up | Increasing fill intensity |

## Mixing Effects

### Filter Effects

Apply filters to the master output:

| Button | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| ++5++ | Low Pass Filter | Removes high frequencies |
| ++6++ | Band Pass Filter | Removes highs and lows |
| ++7++ | High Pass Filter | Removes low frequencies |

### Filter Sweeps

Animated filter effects:

| Button | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| ++13++ | LP Sweep | Low pass filter that sweeps |
| ++14++ | BP Sweep | Band pass filter that sweeps |
| ++15++ | HP Sweep | High pass filter that sweeps |

### Stutter Effects

| Button | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| ++8++ | Stutter 1 | Short audio repeat effect |
| ++16++ | Stutter 2 | Variation of stutter |

## Effect Rules

### One Effect Per Category

Only one effect of the same type can be active at a time:

- Enabling a filter cancels other filters
- Enabling a roll cancels other rolls
- Enabling an auto-fill cancels other auto-fills

### Combining Effects

You can combine effects from different categories:

- Roll + Filter = Filtered rolls
- Fill + Stutter = Glitchy fills
- Filter Sweep + Roll = Building tension

## Using Live FX

### Basic Performance

1. Start your sequence (++play++)
2. Hold **Cpy/FX**
3. Press effect buttons to toggle on/off
4. Release **Cpy/FX** when done

### Building Tension

1. Start with Auto-fill Build-up (++12++)
2. Add HP Filter Sweep (++15++)
3. At the drop, release both

### Creating Breakdowns

1. Enable Low Pass Filter (++5++)
2. Gradually increase filter (touch strip or repeat)
3. Add Fill Steps (++9++) near the end
4. Release for impact

### Quick Fills

- Tap ++9++ briefly for one-shot fills
- Steps with "Fill" condition will trigger once

## Chord Progression Indicator

While holding **Cpy/FX**, the chord progression indicator appears on screen. Use this to time your effects to land on specific chord changes.

## Quick Parameter Control

While holding **Cpy/FX**, the touch strip controls the currently selected track parameter. This lets you perform parameter changes during Live FX.

## Performance Tips

### Plan Your FX

- Map out when to use effects in your arrangement
- Practice transitions between song parts
- Know which effects complement each other

### Less Is More

- Subtle filter movements can be very effective
- Don't overuse rolls - save them for impact moments
- Brief stutters are often more effective than sustained ones

### Build and Release

- Use filters and fills to build tension
- Release effects on strong beats
- Combine with song part changes for maximum impact

### Practice

- Learn the button positions by feel
- Practice effect combinations
- Develop your own performance style
