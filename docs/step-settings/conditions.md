# Trigger Conditions

Trigger conditions determine when a step plays, adding variation and complexity to your patterns.

## Accessing Conditions

1. Enter Step Mode (press ++step++)
2. Select a step
3. Navigate to page 1 (Condition)
4. Use ++up++ / ++down++ to change the condition

## Available Conditions

### Never

The step never plays. Useful for temporarily disabling steps without removing them.

### Probability Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 25% | Step plays 25% of the time |
| 50% | Step plays 50% of the time |
| 75% | Step plays 75% of the time |

Each time the sequencer reaches this step, a random check determines if it plays.

### Always

The step always plays (default). Use for notes that should play every time.

### Fill Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fill | Only plays when a Fill FX is active |
| Not Fill | Only plays when Fill FX is NOT active |

These work with the Live FX Fill modes.

### Repeat Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1:2 | Plays every 2nd time the pattern loops |
| 1:3 | Plays every 3rd time |
| 1:4 | Plays every 4th time |

These are useful for creating variation over multiple loops without changing patterns.

## Using Conditions Creatively

### Ghost Notes

1. Add hi-hat or snare steps
2. Set condition to 50% or 75%
3. Set velocity low
4. Creates subtle, varying ghost notes

### Building Patterns

1. Create a base pattern with "Always" conditions
2. Add additional steps with "Fill" condition
3. Activate Fill FX to trigger the extra steps

### Long Form Variation

1. Use 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 conditions on different steps
2. Pattern sounds different each time it loops
3. Creates interest over 4-8 bar sections

### Call and Response

1. First half of pattern: Always condition
2. Second half: 50% condition
3. Creates varying responses to consistent phrases

## Tips

- Copy steps with conditions to quickly build complex patterns
- Combine multiple probability steps for layered variation
- Use Fill conditions to add controlled complexity during performance
- 1:4 conditions work great for accents every 4th loop
