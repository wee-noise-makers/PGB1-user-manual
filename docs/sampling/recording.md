# Recording Samples

The PGB-1 can record samples directly from its inputs, allowing you to capture sounds anywhere.

## Entering Sample Mode

Hold **Cpy/FX** and press ++edit++ to enter Sample Mode.

Select **New Sample** to begin recording.

## Input Selection

Choose your audio source:

| Input | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Line In | 3.5mm stereo jack input | External devices, synths, phones |
| Internal Mic | Built-in microphone | Voice, ambient sounds |
| Headset Mic | Microphone on connected headset | Voice recording |

## Adjusting Input Gain

Use ++up++ / ++down++ to adjust the input volume before recording.

!!! tip "Best Practice"
    For line input, keep the PGB-1 gain low and increase the volume on your source device. This provides better headroom and less noise.

## Recording Process

### Step 1: Monitor Your Input

With the input selected, you can hear and see the incoming audio level.

### Step 2: Start Recording

Press ++a++ to begin recording.

The PGB-1 uses a **2-second rolling buffer**:

- Audio is continuously recorded
- After 2 seconds, new audio overwrites the oldest
- This allows capturing sounds slightly after they occur

### Step 3: Capture Your Sound

Play or trigger the sound you want to capture. The waveform updates in real-time.

### Step 4: Stop Recording

Press ++a++ again when you have the sound you want.

!!! tip "Rolling Buffer Advantage"
    Since recording is continuous, you can press stop slightly after the sound - the buffer captures what just happened.

## Editing Your Sample

### Setting Start Point

Use ++left++ / ++right++ to move the start point:

- Move right to skip the beginning
- Find where your sound actually starts
- Eliminate silence or unwanted noise

### Setting End Point

Use ++up++ / ++down++ to move the end point:

- Move left to shorten the sample
- Find where your sound naturally ends
- Eliminate tails or unwanted noise

### Preview While Editing

The keyboard LEDs indicate preview keys:

| Button | Octave |
|--------|--------|
| ++1++ | One octave down |
| ++4++ | Original pitch |
| ++8++ | One octave up |
| Other buttons | Various pitches |

Press these keys to preview your sample at different pitches while adjusting start/end points.

## Saving Your Sample

1. Press ++a++ when editing is complete
2. Enter a name (optional)
3. Press ++a++ to select a sample slot (1-64)
4. Navigate to **Yes** and confirm

!!! warning "Overwrite Warning"
    Saving to an occupied slot will replace the existing sample.

## Recording Tips

### Multiple Sounds in One Sample

Record several short sounds in sequence:

1. Play sound 1
2. Wait briefly
3. Play sound 2
4. Stop recording

Then use parameter locks to set different start points per step, effectively getting multiple samples from one slot.

### Clean Recordings

- Reduce background noise before recording
- Use line in when possible for cleaner signals
- Adjust gain to avoid clipping (distortion)

### Useful Samples

- Single drum hits
- Short melodic phrases
- Vocal chops
- Sound effects
- One-shots from other devices

## Sample Limitations

- Maximum 2 seconds per sample
- 64 sample slots total
- Samples are mono
- Sample memory is shared across the project
