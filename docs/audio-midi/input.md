## Using Line Input

### Connecting External Devices

1. Use a 3.5mm stereo cable
2. Connect source to Line In jack
3. Enable Line In in the Input menu
4. Adjust volume/gain as needed

### Gain Staging

!!! tip "Best Practice"
    Keep the PGB-1 input gain low and increase volume on your source device. This provides better headroom and less noise.

### Example: Pocket Operator

1. Connect PO audio out to PGB-1 Line In
2. Enable Line In
3. Set PGB-1 input volume low
4. Increase PO volume for good level
5. Both devices play through PGB-1 output

## Using Internal Microphone

### Recording Samples

The internal mic is useful for:

- Voice recordings
- Acoustic sounds
- Found sounds and field recording
- Quick sample captures

### Gain Adjustment

The internal mic typically needs higher gain:

1. Enable Int. Mic in Input settings
2. Increase Volume/Gain setting
3. Test recording levels
4. Adjust as needed

## Input Effects

Apply real-time effects to your input signal:

### Overdrive

- Adds warmth and distortion
- Good for guitar or bass input
- Creates grit on voice

### Beat Crusher

- Lo-fi digital character
- Reduces bit depth and sample rate
- Creative destruction effect

### Reverb

- Adds space and depth
- Smooths harsh recordings

4. Choose your input source
5. Adjust gain
6. Record your sample

## Tips

### Monitoring

When inputs are enabled, audio passes through to the output. This lets you:

- Monitor external sources while playing
- Process external audio through PGB-1 effects
- Mix external audio with your sequences

### Live Performance

- Bring in external elements during performance
- Apply effects to live input
- Layer with internal sequences

### Recording Quality

- Use Line In for best quality when possible
- Internal mic works but has more noise
- Good source audio = good samples
