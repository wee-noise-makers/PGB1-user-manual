# Song Parts

Song Parts are sections of your song where you define which patterns play on which tracks. They're the building blocks for arranging complete tracks.

## Understanding Song Parts

- The PGB-1 has **12 Song Parts** (buttons 1-12 in Song Mode)
- Each part specifies a pattern for each of the 16 tracks
- Parts can have different chord progressions
- Parts can be linked to auto-advance

## Accessing Song Parts

1. Press ++song++ to enter Song Mode
2. Press ++1++ to ++12++ to select and queue a song part

### Queuing vs Selecting

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Press ++1++-++12++ | Selects AND queues the part (it will play next) |
| Hold ++song++ + Press ++1++-++12++ | Selects without queuing (for editing) |

When a part is queued, it will start playing after the current part completes its full cycle.

## Song Part Settings

### Pattern Grid

The main display shows a 4x4 grid representing all 16 tracks:

```
Track:  1   2   3   4
        5   6   7   8
        9  10  11  12
       13  14  15  16
```

Each cell shows which pattern will play:

| Display | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Number (1-16) | Pattern number to play |
| Empty | Track is muted |

### Editing the Grid

1. Use ++up++ / ++down++ to change the pattern number
2. Press ++b++ to mute a track (empty cell)
3. Press ++a++ to unmute
4. Use ++left++ / ++right++ to move between cells

### Part Settings

Press ++b++ to move focus to the settings at the bottom of the screen:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Length | Number of repetitions before part change allowed |
| Chords | Which chord progression (13-16) to use |
| Link | Connect to next part for auto-advance |

## Creating Song Arrangements

### Basic Structure

**Part 1 - Intro**

- Minimal tracks: just kick and bass
- Simple patterns

**Part 2 - Verse**

- Add drums and hi-hat
- Keep lead simple

**Part 3 - Chorus**

- Full arrangement
- Complex patterns
- Different chord progression

**Part 4 - Break**

- Strip down to pads or bass
- Build tension

### Practical Example

| Part | Tracks Active | Pattern | Chords |
|------|---------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Kick, Bass | Pattern 1 | Prog 13 |
| 2 | All drums, Bass, Lead | Pattern 1 | Prog 13 |
| 3 | All drums, Bass, Lead, Chords | Pattern 2 | Prog 14 |
| 4 | Hi-hat, Bass | Pattern 1 | Prog 13 |

## Part Linking

Enable Link to automatically advance to the next part:

1. Select a part
2. Navigate to the Link setting
3. Press ++a++ to enable

Linked parts flow automatically during playback, useful for:

- Intro → Verse transitions
- Building arrangements that play automatically
- Creating medleys

## Performance Tips

### Live Part Switching

1. Queue parts while the current part plays
2. The change happens at the end of the current cycle
3. Watch the chord progression indicator to time changes

### Muting Tracks

In Song Mode, modify which tracks play by:

- Changing pattern to empty (mute)
- Using different patterns for variations

### Quick Mutes

Hold ++play++ + press ++1++-++16++ to mute/unmute tracks during playback without changing song parts.

## Tips

- Create at least 4 distinct parts for a complete arrangement
- Use the same patterns with different mutes for subtle variations
- Link parts for rehearsed performances
- Keep parts unlinked for improvised live sets
