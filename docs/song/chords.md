# Chord Progressions

The PGB-1 features a powerful chord system that automatically harmonizes your bass lines, leads, and melodies.

## Understanding Chord Progressions

- 4 chord progression slots (buttons 13-16 in Song Mode)
- Each song part can use any progression
- Bass and lead tracks automatically follow chord changes
- The Chords track plays full polyphonic chords

## Accessing Chord Progressions

1. Press ++song++ to enter Song Mode
2. Press ++13++, ++14++, ++15++, or ++16++ to edit that progression

## Chord Settings

For each chord in the progression:

### Root Note

The base note of the chord (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B).

Use ++up++ / ++down++ to change.

### Quality

The chord type:

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Major | Bright, happy |
| Minor | Dark, sad |
| Diminished | Tense, unstable |
| Augmented | Unusual, dreamy |
| Sus2 | Open, ambiguous |
| Sus4 | Anticipating resolution |
| 7th variations | Jazz-influenced |

### Length

How many steps the chord lasts before moving to the next chord.

Common lengths:

| Length | Bars (at 4 steps per beat) |
|--------|---------------------------|
| 4 | 1 beat |
| 8 | 2 beats (half bar) |
| 16 | 4 beats (1 bar) |
| 32 | 2 bars |

## Building a Progression

### Adding Chords

1. Navigate to the last chord in the progression
2. Press ++right++ to go past the final setting
3. Press ++a++ to add a new chord
4. Configure root, quality, and length

### Removing Chords

1. Navigate to a chord's settings
2. Go to the add/remove page
3. Press ++b++ to remove the chord

### Example: Classic Pop Progression

| Chord | Root | Quality | Length |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | C | Major | 16 |
| 2 | G | Major | 16 |
| 3 | A | Minor | 16 |
| 4 | F | Major | 16 |

This creates a I-V-vi-IV progression in C major.

## Random Generation

The last page of chord settings offers random generation:

1. Navigate to the random page
2. Use ++up++ / ++down++ to select a scale:
    - **Major** - Bright, common scales
    - **Minor** - Dark, emotional scales
    - **Modal** - Exotic, unusual scales
3. Press ++a++ to generate
4. Press ++a++ again to try different progressions

## Chord Progression Indicator

While playing, a visual indicator shows your position in the chord progression:

- Small dots represent each chord
- An arrow shows the current chord
- Appears in the main display and Cpy/FX menu

Use this to time:

- Song part changes
- Live effects
- Transitions

## How Tracks Use Chords

### Bass Track (Track 4)

- Steps default to the chord root note
- Automatically follows progression
- Can be set to other chord notes in Step Mode

### Lead Track (Track 5)

- Steps use arpeggiator by default
- Plays notes from the current chord
- Melodies automatically harmonize

### Chords Track (Track 6)

- The only polyphonic track
- Plays full chords
- Can play different voicings per step

### Other Tracks

- Can be set to follow chords in Step Mode
- Drums typically use fixed notes

## Multiple Progressions

Use different progressions for different song sections:

| Part | Progression | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 (Intro) | Prog 13 | Single chord or simple |
| 2 (Verse) | Prog 13 | Main progression |
| 3 (Chorus) | Prog 14 | Different energy |
| 4 (Bridge) | Prog 15 | Contrast |

## Tips

- Start with simple 2-4 chord progressions
- Use the random generator for inspiration
- Longer chord lengths feel more relaxed
- Shorter lengths create energy
- Watch the indicator to time your part changes
- The Chords track is optional - bass and lead follow chords even without it
